# Letter Combinations of a Phone Number  

## Description  
This project implements a web-based solution for generating all possible letter combinations for a given phone number using a traditional phone keypad mapping. The app is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**, providing a user-friendly interface and interactive experience.  

### Problem Statement  
Write a function that returns all possible letter combinations a phone number could represent based on the mapping:  

| Digit | Letters |
|-------|---------|
| 2     | abc     |
| 3     | def     |
| 4     | ghi     |
| 5     | jkl     |
| 6     | mno     |
| 7     | pqrs    |
| 8     | tuv     |
| 9     | wxyz    |

#### Input  
- A string `digits` containing numbers from 2 to 9 (e.g., `"23"`).  

#### Output  
- A list of strings, where each string represents a possible letter combination.  

### Example  
Input:  
digits = "23"


Output:  
["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]


## Features  
- User-friendly interface built with Bootstrap.  
- Dynamic generation of letter combinations using JavaScript.  
- Responsive design to work on all devices.
